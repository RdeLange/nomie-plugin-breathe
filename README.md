Most of the options are self explanatory. The Inhale/Hold/Exhale/Hold section will define the duration of each step per breathing cycle.

The Repeats section defines the amount of repeats for the above defined cycle.

Once ready with editing you can select the 'Proceed' button.

### Starting an exercise

You can start an exercise by clicking on one of the selected breathings on the main screen. You will see the following screen:

Before you click the start button, you can still change the amount of repeats. Once clicked, the exercise will start and you will be guided by the animated circle:

First of all you can define to which Trackables the duration and the repeats will be logged after you finsihed an exercise. In above example I log my results in the Trackables 'Breathings Repeats' & 'Breathing Time'

You can also include some additional text in your log/note. Within this text you can use the keywords breathing, repeats and minutes to represent these parameters from the exercise you just finished. Please make sure to include these keywords between <>.

The final Reset option is descructive üòÑ It will reset the plugin and remove all your predefined exercises on the main screen.

Well, I guess there is nothing more to explain.

As always...have fun with it!
